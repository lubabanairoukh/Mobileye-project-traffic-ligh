Day Two:

Milestones:
Implement another function that crops the area around these identified points.

End Goal:
Generate cropped images that contain potential traffic lights.

Focus On:
Keeping the code clean and simple.
Making every step of the image processing clear and readable by dividing tasks into functions, adding proper documentation, and ensuring clarity in the code.
Testing and validation: try to test your functions with different inputs to make sure they're working as expected. Consider using assert statements or even writing formal unit tests.
Modularity and reusability: strive to make your functions modular and reusable. Each function should ideally have a single responsibility and be reusable in different contexts.
Code commenting: good comments don't explain what the code is doing, but why it's doing it. Explain your logic and reasoning where necessary.

### IMPORTANT:
Notice that all crops should be of the same size
